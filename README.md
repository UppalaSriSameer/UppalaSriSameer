# Hello World! How's it going! 👋

I'm Uppala Sri Sameer, just your regular data science fan, trying to make sense of all those numbers and codes without summoning any scary spreadsheet creatures. Yup, I'm that second-year student still figuring out if "pandas" means cuddly bears or some fancy Python thingy (hint: it's the fancy stuff).
You know you're deep into the data world when your idea of a fun Friday night involves binge-watching machine learning videos instead of the latest Netflix shows. But hey, who needs all that drama when you've got data to play with, right?
I'm currently cruising through my second year of data science studies, just about understanding enough to take a few risks here and there. You might catch me trying to explain linear regression to my cat, who's more into chasing shadows than understanding fancy math.
